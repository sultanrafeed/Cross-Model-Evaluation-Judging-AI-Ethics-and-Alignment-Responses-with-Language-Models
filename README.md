# Judging-LLMs-with-LLMS

In the context of natural language processing and conversa-
tional AI, it is crucial to ensure that the responses generated by
language models (LMs) are not only syntactically correct but
also contextually relevant, ethically sound, and aligned with
the desired quality standards. This study aims to evaluate the
quality of previously generated responses using various large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators.

**LMs evaluate the generated responses. Our methodology
includes evaluating different LLMs and scoring from 0 to 5. We compare this
with human evaluations, which is an existing approach to assess consistency
and accuracy in ethical judgment tasks.**
